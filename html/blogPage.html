                    <h5>Her philosophy, March, 2020</h5>
                    <p>Over years of working for others, what struck me was either mediocre eyewear, outdated testing
                        equipment in the back room, or both. ABC Opticals brings together the world’s finest
                        and funkiest eyewear designers, coupled with state of the art equipment to make the eye
                        examination
                        a very civilised affair.
                        We enjoy selling quality products, and most importantly, we enjoy finding the right frame for
                        the
                        right person. That's what we do and we do it well. We don't sell eyewear over the net, so visit
                        us
                        in person. We're worth the effort and your eyes should be too. Finally, we believe that children
                        should be treated as special people so all our staff will make the experience at ABC Opticals
                        the
                        best we can for your child.

                    <h4>Bio</h4>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Amanda B Cormer and I'm the owner of ABC Opticals, and I'd like to briefly
                        introduce
                        you to who we are. I'm an optometrist with 20 years’ experience, having worked for independents
                        and
                        chain stores both here and in London. It was in London that I gravitated to the groovy, high end
                        of
                        the market and returned to Brisbane 9 years ago with a new concept.</p>
